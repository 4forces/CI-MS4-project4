# Upbeat Engineering - Missing engineering components? Look no further.

<img src="static/img/readme/title-pic.PNG" width="800" style="margin:0">

## Overview

If you are someone who has interest in tinkering with mechatronics, want to make robots that can help you do things in life, yet know not where to get components. 
Upbeat Engineering is here to help you. We offer sales of electronic components at affordable prices. We know that building electronics sometimes depends on inspiration and the 'feel'
which may be lost if there is a delay or absence of the right parts. So we offer ourself as a swift source of components. Your order will reach you no later than 3 workind days, right here in Singapore.
We are also looking to expand our services to product design and engineering kits for the youth education. 

This project is deployed on Heroku [here](https://ci-ms3-giftkids.herokuapp.com/).

### Objective

Upbeat Engineering is a based on a true concept from the developer's relative, a mechatronics enthusiast looking to expand his network of similar minded hobbyist by sharing his hardware and 
electronic parts (with a small fee). He knows by experience that building robots and devices do not move in a linear manner, resulting in spare parts and unused components, and sometimes a deterence to inspiration. 
Parts and orders usually comes from overseas, with waiting time and a higher price. The purpose of Upbeat Engineering is to help like minded enthusiasts have a shorter lead time to getting what they need, so they can 
quickly get back on track with building. 

***

## UX and UI

- For this project, this developer decided to do up the frontend html first proceeding to Django. Reason being to have an overview of the look and layout first before integrating into Django. 

This site is designed in mind to be visually appealing to parents and kids-lovers. From the 
[colour palette](https://github.com/4forces/CI-MS3-project3/tree/master/static/img/readme/color-palette2.png) used to the font family 
([Fredoka One](https://github.com/4forces/CI-MS3-project3/tree/master/static/img/readme/font-fredokaone.PNG) for headings, 
[Ubuntu](https://github.com/4forces/CI-MS3-project3/tree/master/static/img/readme/font-ubuntu.PNG) for content). 

This site aims to model itself after sites that sell children related items. 
The reference websites for the color scheme, the look and feel is obtained from the website: 
["Jadusona"](https://demo.hasthemes.com/shopify/jadusona-cm.html), from various examples in 
the "Homepage Layouts." section. This website  was chanced upon while searching for children 
website inspirations on [Pinterest](https://www.pinterest.com/).

The fonts used are from Google Fonts:
- [Fredoka One](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Fredoka+One?query=fredoka) 
- [Ubuntu](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Ubuntu?query=ubuntu)

The colour palette used is as follows: 

<img src="static/img/readme/color-palette2.png" width="800" style="margin:0">

### User stories

1. "I believe child-bringing resources that are still usable should be shared, since young children outgrow their belongings so quickly." - *A parent who believes in sharing items that can still be used*
2. "I wish to give away used items from bringing up my children. As they have only been used a short while, it wil be a waste to throw it away." - *A generous soul*
3. "I have many unopened gifts (toys and clothes) from well-wishers, that I hope to bless other families with." - *Someone who has received many blessings and wishes to do same for other children*

## Features

This site has 5 main sections: 

- [Landing page](#Landing-page) 
- [Browse all items](#Browse-all-items)
- [Item search](#Item-search)
- [Submit new item](#Submit-new-item)
- [Update/Remove item entry](#updateremove-item-entry)

### Landing Page

This is the first page the visitor sees upon [arrival at this site](https://github.com/4forces/CI-MS3-project3/tree/master/static/img/readme/landing-page.PNG). 
The visitor is greeted with a welcome message, which has a [background image]() of a child playing with toys.
A repeated graphic of children's toys is used as a matching
background to the theme of this site. 
There are four buttons linking to the other features of the site:
- Browse all
- Item Search
- Submit New item
- Update or Remove Entry

The visitor may also access the other features via the links on the navbar.

### Browse All items

Visitors are able to view items that have been submitted by other visitors or themselves. 
All items that have been submitted are listed on [this page](https://github.com/4forces/CI-MS3-project3/tree/master/static/img/readme/browse2.png), starting with the most recent. When the visitor mouse-over, 
the item-box will increase in size, indicating that it can be clicked on, leading to the **Item Details page**. 
Under **"CRUD"**, this section will fall under **"Read"**.

#### Item Details page

[This page](https://github.com/4forces/CI-MS3-project3/tree/master/static/img/readme/item-details.PNG) shows all the information the visitor has keyed in when submitting the item:

- Item name
- Description
- Item type
- Age range
- Condition
- Date submitted
- Nickname of donor
- Contact email of donor

The information is wrapped nicely and framed with an [image of children's clothes](https://github.com/4forces/CI-MS3-project3/tree/master/static/img/details.jpg).

### Item Search

Visitors can search for items by item name and item type. There are five item types to select from:
- Toys & Playthings
- Clothes & Wardrobe
- Maternity (E.g. Pumps, Nursing pads)
- Accessories (E.g. Strollers, Car seats)
- Others

In line with the website's theme, the search box background is an [image of a little girl's dress](https://github.com/4forces/CI-MS3-project3/tree/master/static/img/search.jpg)
A screenshot of the item search page [here](https://github.com/4forces/CI-MS3-project3/tree/master/static/img/readme/search-page.png). 

This section also covers the **"Read"** of **"CRUD"**

### Submit New Item

Users can submit items here. This page ([screenshot](https://github.com/4forces/CI-MS3-project3/tree/master/static/img/readme/submit-item.PNG)) requires the donor to input the following item fields:
1. Nickname of donor
2. Contact email
3. Item name
4. Description (Optional field)
5. Item type (Choose from 5 categories)
6. Age range (Infant, Toddler or Preschooler)
7. Condition (New, Like New, Used)
8. Delete after (1 week, 1 month, 3 months. Default selection is 1 month)

The "Submit Item" box is also nicely framed with a related background [image](https://github.com/4forces/CI-MS3-project3/tree/master/static/img/post.jpg).

This is the **"Create"** part of **"CRUD"**.

Behind the scenes, the following JavaScript was used to capture the date and time of the submission:
This data was passed to a hidden html element and captured as part of the `request.form` method. The 
JavaScript and HTML code blocks are appended.

```javascript
// Javascript to capture date and time of submission
function getDate() {
  let dateSubStr = Date().substring(4,15) + ', ' + Date().substring(16,24) ;
  document.getElementById('date').value = dateSubStr;
}
```
```html
<!--hidden html input element in post_item.template.html -->
<input id="date" name="date" hidden>
```
### Update/Remove item entry

This page ([screenshot](https://github.com/4forces/CI-MS3-project3/tree/master/static/img/readme/update-remove.PNG)) lists all the items submitted, with the option to **Edit** or **Delete** items. 
If needed, users can update their item fields from this page.
In the event the user wishes to remove his or her item, it can also be done here.
Upon hover of the "Edit" and "Delete" buttons, an icon appears in the buttons to signal 
an expected action from the user.
This page covers the **"Update"** and **"Destroy"** portions of **"CRUD"**.

#### "Edit Item" Page

Upon clicking on the "Edit" button, the user is brought to the "Edit Item" page ([screenshot](https://github.com/4forces/CI-MS3-project3/tree/master/static/img/readme/edit-item.PNG)). 
The item values are pulled from the database and displayed in its respective fields for the user to modify.
This page has a custom [image of toys](https://github.com/4forces/CI-MS3-project3/tree/master/static/img/edit.jpg) as background to suit the site theme.

#### "Delete Item" Page

When the "Delete" button is clicked, the site prompts the user if he or she wishes to proceed with the deletion. 
A screenshot of the confirmation page [here](https://github.com/4forces/CI-MS3-project3/tree/master/static/img/readme/delete-item.PNG). Red colour is used as the background of the dialog box, 
and the "Confirm" button to highlight to the user that deletion is a serious action since it is irreversible. 

### Features Left to Implement

1. **User Login** - For improved management (editing and deletion) of user submitted items
2. **Submit item page: Picture upload** - It is usually common for visitors to expect to see pictures as 
part of their consideration before acquiring the item
3. **Submit item page: Multi options selection for age range** - For example, some items can be used by both toddlers and pres-choolers
3. **Submit items: Auto deletion of submitted post** - This will be will be a good-to-have for items management
4. **Browse page: Item tagging** - Cross-item referencing will help visitors in their search for items
5. **Browse and Search pages: Option to sort by date of submission** - For better user experience. Current feature is just from newest to oldest
6. **Browse and Search pages: Pagination of browse/search results** - Currently all items are shown
7. **Browse and Search pages: "Back to top button** - For a more pleasant user experience
8. **Search page: More search filters, for e.g. by condition, age range** - Also for optimal user experience
9. **Edit page: "Go Back" button to return to update/remove page** - User can still click on the Update/Remove on the navbar, but this may not be  intuitive or obvious
10. **Edit page: Auto-store "current date and time" upon Edit** - Currently this is only implemented when user submits item
11. **Edit and Delete buttons: Fading out of text, and fading in of icon upon mouse-over** - For better aesthetics. Refer to last point in *Additional Notes on the Development of Features* for more information
12. **Auto delete post after 1 month, 3 months or 1 week as indicated by user during item submission** - Currently this value is only being stored and not used


### Additional Notes on the Development of Features

**Solution to resolve favicon 404 error at Edit/Delete item page:** Referred to this post at [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27234593/setting-up-static-folder-path-in-flask1)
to resolve favicon could not load (404) error when viewing the *Edit page* and *Confirm Delete page*. 

**Code for writing the CRUD Functions:** [Tim Nelson's (CI) Task Manager](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Solutions/TaskManager/tree/master/08-SearchingWithinTheDatabase/01-text_index_searching)
example was very helpful reference, especially when coding the *Create* and *Update* features. 

**Reversing Order of Items Displayed (Most recent submissions first):** The original order of items for *Search* and *Browse* pages was oldest submissions at the top. 
To reverse this order a solution was found on [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45699660/jinja2-reverse-a-list).

**Box Shadows for Contrast:** Box shadows were added so that the pages will not look too "flat".
The styles for box shadows were adopted from [CSS Scan](https://getcssscan.com/css-box-shadow-examples).


**Manipulating toastr Pop-up Elements:**
For a better visual experience, [toastr](https://github.com/CodeSeven/toastr) was implemented for the flash messages. 
[This site](https://codeseven.github.io/toastr/demo.html) and [this site](http://plnkr.co/edit/6W9URNyyp2ItO4aUWzBB?preview) was studied intently on the usage of `toastr.options`.
Issues with `toastr.options` was resolved with guidance from [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44110049/toastr-options-dont-work).


**Resolve "Template Syntax Error" when displaying *item_details* page:** At one point in the development process, displaying **item_details.template.html** gave the following error:
```
template syntax error: expected token ':', got '}
```
A solution was eventually found [here](https://groups.google.com/g/pocoo-libs/c/hZIO4DziL2E?pli=1).


**Displaying Icons for Edit and Delete Buttons Upon Mouse-Over:**
The initial concept arose from [here](https://webdeasy.de/en/top-css-buttons-en/?referer=dev-updated-f41).
In the beginning, JavaScript method  (referenced from [here](https://www.w3schools.com/Jsref/event_onmouseover.asp)) was used to achieve transition
effect. However, the transition was abrupt and not smooth. Alternative workarounds were explored via CSS and tested out, referencing from stackoverflow [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44573480/change-text-content-on-hover) and 
[here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33057737/css-replacing-a-text-on-hover-but-smooth-transition-to-the-new-text-does-not-w).
Eventually, with reference from [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3331353/transitions-on-the-css-display-property) (also stackoverflow), it was decided 
to have the icons hidden, and displayed only when mouse-over. As to how to point to fontawesome content in CSS, this [link](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20782368/use-font-awesome-icon-as-css-content) gave an explanation.
